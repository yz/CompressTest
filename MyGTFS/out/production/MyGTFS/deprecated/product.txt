 We observe 2day 95vic2ry 1 party but5celebration 1 freedom--symboliz6g an end as 4ll as5beg6n6g--signify6g renewal as 4ll as change. For I have sworn before you 3 Almighty God 0 same solemn oath 7 forbears prescribed nearly5century 3 three-quarters ago.

The world is very different now. For man holds 6 his mortal h3s 0 po4r 2 abolish all forms 1 human poverty 3 all forms 1 human life. And yet 0 same revolutionary beliefs for which 7 forebears fought are still at issue around 0 globe--0 belief 8 0 rights 1 man come 9 from 0 generosity 1 0 state but from 0 h3 1 God.

We dare 9 forget 2day 8 4 are 0 heirs 1 8 first revolution. Let 0 word go forth from this time 3 place, 2 friend 3 foe alike, 8 0 2rch has been passed 25new generation 1 Americans--born 6 this century, tempered by war, discipl6ed by5hard 3 bitter peace, proud 1 7 ancient heritage--3 unwill6g 2 witness or permit 0 slow undo6g 1 those human rights 2 which this nation has always been committed, 3 2 which 4 are committed 2day at home 3 around 0 world.

Let every nation know, whe0r it wishes us 4ll or ill, 8 4 shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe 2 assure 0 survival 3 0 success 1 liberty.

This much 4 pledge--3 more.

To those old allies whose cultural 3 spiritual orig6s 4 share, 4 pledge 0 loyalty 1 faithful friends. United 0re is little 4 can9 do 65host 1 cooperative ventures. Divided 0re is little 4 can do--for 4 dare 9 meet5po4rful challenge at odds 3 split asunder.

To those new states whom 4 4lcome 2 0 ranks 1 0 free, 4 pledge 7 word 8 one form 1 colonial control shall 9 have passed away merely 2 be replaced by5far more iron tyranny. We shall 9 always expect 2 f6d 0m support6g 7 view. But 4 shall always hope 2 f6d 0m strongly support6g 0ir own freedom--3 2 remember 8, 6 0 past, those who foolishly sought po4r by rid6g 0 back 1 0 tiger ended up 6side.

To those people 6 0 huts 3 villages 1 half 0 globe struggl6g 2 break 0 bonds 1 mass misery, 4 pledge 7 best efforts 2 help 0m help 0mselves, for whatever period is required--9 because 0 communists may be do6g it, 9 because 4 seek 0ir votes, but because it is right. If5free society can9 help 0 many who are poor, it can9 save 0 few who are rich.

To 7 sister republics south 1 7 border, 4 1fer5special pledge--2 convert 7 good words 62 good deeds--65new alliance for progress--2 assist free men 3 free governments 6 cast6g 1f 0 cha6s 1 poverty. But this peaceful revolution 1 hope can9 become 0 prey 1 hostile po4rs. Let all 7 neighbors know 8 4 shall jo6 with 0m 2 oppose aggression or subversion anywhere 6 0 Americas. And let every o0r po4r know 8 this Hemisphere 6tends 2 rema6 0 master 1 its own house.

To 8 world assembly 1 sovereign states, 0 United Nations, 7 last best hope 6 an age where 0 6struments 1 war have far outpaced 0 6struments 1 peace, 4 renew 7 pledge 1 support--2 prevent it from becom6g merely5forum for 6vective--2 streng0n its shield 1 0 new 3 0 4ak--3 2 enlarge 0 area 6 which its writ may run.

F6ally, 2 those nations who would make 0mselves 7 adversary, 4 1fer 95pledge but5request: 8 both sides beg6 anew 0 quest for peace, before 0 dark po4rs 1 destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity 6 planned or accidental self-destruction.

We dare 9 tempt 0m with 4akness. For only when 7 arms are sufficient beyond doubt can 4 be certa6 beyond doubt 8 0y will never be employed.

But nei0r can two great 3 po4rful groups 1 nations take comfort from 7 present c7se--both sides overburdened by 0 cost 1 modern 4apons, both rightly alarmed by 0 steady spread 1 0 deadly a2m, yet both rac6g 2 alter 8 uncerta6 balance 1 terror 8 stays 0 h3 1 mank6d's f6al war.

So let us beg6 anew--remember6g on both sides 8 civility is 95sign 1 4akness, 3 s6cerity is always subject 2 pro1. Let us never negotiate out 1 fear. But let us never fear 2 negotiate.

Let both sides explore what problems unite us 6stead 1 belabor6g those problems which divide us.

Let both sides, for 0 first time, formulate serious 3 precise proposals for 0 6spection 3 control 1 arms--3 br6g 0 absolute po4r 2 destroy o0r nations under 0 absolute control 1 all nations.

Let both sides seek 2 6voke 0 wonders 1 science 6stead 1 its terrors. Toge0r let us explore 0 stars, conquer 0 deserts, eradicate disease, tap 0 ocean depths 3 enc7age 0 arts 3 commerce.

Let both sides unite 2 heed 6 all corners 1 0 earth 0 comm3 1 Isaiah--2 "undo 0 heavy burdens . . . (3) let 0 oppressed go free."

And if5beachhead 1 cooperation may push back 0 jungle 1 suspicion, let both sides jo6 6 creat6g5new endeavor, 95new balance 1 po4r, but5new world 1 law, where 0 strong are just 3 0 4ak secure 3 0 peace preserved.

All this will 9 be f6ished 6 0 first one hundred days. Nor will it be f6ished 6 0 first one thous3 days, nor 6 0 life 1 this Adm6istration, nor even perhaps 6 7 lifetime on this planet. But let us beg6.

In y7 h3s, my fellow citizens, more than m6e, will rest 0 f6al success or failure 1 7 c7se. S6ce this country was founded, each generation 1 Americans has been summoned 2 give testimony 2 its national loyalty. The graves 1 young Americans who ans4red 0 call 2 service surround 0 globe.

Now 0 trumpet summons us aga6--9 as5call 2 bear arms, though arms 4 need--9 as5call 2 battle, though embattled 4 are-- but5call 2 bear 0 burden 15long twilight struggle, year 6 3 year out, "rejoic6g 6 hope, patient 6 tribulation"--a struggle aga6st 0 common enemies 1 man: tyranny, poverty, disease 3 war itself.

Can 4 forge aga6st 0se enemies5gr3 3 global alliance, North 3 South, East 3 West, 8 can assure5more fruitful life for all mank6d? Will you jo6 6 8 his2ric effort?

In 0 long his2ry 1 0 world, only5few generations have been granted 0 role 1 defend6g freedom 6 its h7 1 maximum danger. I do 9 shr6k from this responsibility--I 4lcome it. I do 9 believe 8 any 1 us would exchange places with any o0r people or any o0r generation. The energy, 0 faith, 0 devotion which 4 br6g 2 this endeavor will light 7 country 3 all who serve it--3 0 glow from 8 fire can truly light 0 world.

And so, my fellow Americans: ask 9 what y7 country can do for you--ask what you can do for y7 country.

My fellow citizens 1 0 world: ask 9 what America will do for you, but what 2ge0r 4 can do for 0 freedom 1 man.

F6ally, whe0r you are citizens 1 America or citizens 1 0 world, ask 1 us here 0 same high st3ards 1 strength 3 sacrifice which 4 ask 1 you. With5good conscience 7 only sure reward, with his2ry 0 f6al judge 1 7 deeds, let us go forth 2 lead 0 l3 4 love, ask6g His bless6g 3 His help, but know6g 8 here on earth God's work must truly be 7 own.
